# hello-world
My first GitHub Repository

My name is Anthony Venturini. I am a proud father who has been teaching himself about computer programming, specifically HTML, CSS and JS up to this point, for about 4 months now. I just found out, somewhat, how useful and important GitHub is or can be in this industry and so I am now here learning what this place is all about. For now I am stuck with teaching myself through various online resources about what it is to be a Software Engineer and slowly but steadily learning the necessary skills required to break into a career in the IT field. If you are reading this and feeling generous with what knowledge you might possess I am always open to any advise or suggestions, so please feel free to share if you'd like.
